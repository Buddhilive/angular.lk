# Angular Language Kit (LK)

**Angular Language Kit** is a privacy-first AI chat application built with Angular. It leverages **Chrome's Built-in AI** (Gemini Nano) to run Large Language Models directly in your browser. This means your data is processed locally—**offline**—without ever being sent to a cloud server.
